Welcome to my Advent of Code 2022 repository!

Advent of Code is an annual event in which participants solve a series of coding challenges released daily from December 1st to December 25th. Each day's challenge consists of two parts, and each part builds on the skills and knowledge learned from previous challenges.

I am participating in Advent of Code 2022 to improve my skills in data manipulation, algorithms, data structures, and problem solving. These are important skills to have as a software developer, as they allow me to write efficient and effective code to solve real-world problems.
